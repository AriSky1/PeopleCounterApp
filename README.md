The main goal of this project was to try to count the exact number of pedestrians on the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world - Shibuya, but I didn't achieve the exÃªcted results.

I eventually made an app that counts pedestrians on videos. The user can provide a YouTube link or chose available streams.

Despite using fast models (YOLOv8, Background Substractor MOG2), the streams are quite slow.
